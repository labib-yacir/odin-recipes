        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe is very adaptable as far as what and how much you add to
            the basic dough. I used a normal amount of chips, but this amount
            can be doubled without issue. You can also toss in dried fruit and
            nuts fearlessly.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ⅛ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>⅓ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white chocolate chips</li>
            <li>⅓ cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking
                sheet with a silicon mat or parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mash the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a
                large mixing bowl with a spatula until creamy and smooth, 2 to 3
                minutes. Add the egg and vanilla; whisk vigorously for 20 to 30
                seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda together in a small bowl;
                dump into the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Fold
                the semi-sweet chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and milk
                chocolate chips into the mixture. Arrange onto the prepared
                baking sheet using a small scoop or large spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes;
                remove from oven and allow to cool on the sheet for 10 minutes.
                Transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling completely.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <strong>Tips:</strong> the amounts of chocolate chips can be doubled
            for extra-decadent cookies!
